  ## **Description**
  Cupids Crush is a website built using React.js to display current team or individual standings for a competition. It is being built to be used for local events, though it can be easily used anywhere with a few adjustments. The website makes API calls to receive the current standings from the database being used in the competition. It is still in development, especially the UI portion. There is currently no deployed version of the application.
